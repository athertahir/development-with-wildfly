Modifying your archive {.title style="clear: both"}
----------------------

* * * * *

In our previous examples, each time we created the `Swarm`
instance and applied some configuration on top of it, we used the
no-argument `deploy` method. This method takes the archive
generated by the standard Maven build and deploys it on the previously
configured container. This is not the only version of the
`deploy` method, though. You are able to create your own
archive (or archives) and deploy them to the Swarm container. How? It is
possible using the `ShrinkWrap` API.

### The ShrinkWrap API {.title}

If you have ever worked with WildFly AS, and, especially, its testing
framework Arquillian, you are probably also familiar with
the `ShrinkWrap` API, which is used to build application
archives before they are deployed in the test environment. However, if
you have never used it, don't worry—the API is very simple and
straightforward.

The central class in the API is the
`org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.Archive`* *instance. It is an
abstract class that represents the archive. The concrete implementations
that interest us the most
are `org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.spec.JavaArchive`
and `org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.spec.WebArchive` that represent
JARs and WARs as you probably have guessed. The API is simple; it
contains a bunch of methods that allow you to add resources to the
archive. Let's see its operation in practice.

For the sake of this example, let's return to the first
`CatalogService` version, which contained only
the `jaxrs` resource and application.

### Note {.title}

Examples reference: `chapter4/catalog-service-shrinkwrap`

To see the`ShrinkWrap` in action, we have to modify the
`pom.xml`* *file:

Copy

``` {.programlisting .language-markup}
(...)

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.jboss.spec.javax.ws.rs</groupId>
            <artifactId>jboss-jaxrs-api_2.0_spec</artifactId>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
        <!-- 1 -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
            <artifactId>jaxrs</artifactId>
            <version>${version.wildfly.swarm}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>${version.war.plugin}</version>
                <configuration>
                    <failOnMissingWebXml>false</failOnMissingWebXml>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
                <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>${version.wildfly.swarm}</version>
                <!-- 2 -->
                <configuration>
                    <mainClass>org.packt.swarm.petstore.catalog.Main</mainClass>
                </configuration>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>package</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>

(...)
```

As we are providing our own `main`, we have to explicitly add
the dependency on the `jaxrs` fraction (1). We also have to
add the method to the Swarm plugin configuration (2).

Let's look at the `ShrinkWrap` API usage in the
`org.packt.swarm.petstore.Main` class:

Copy

``` {.programlisting .language-markup}
package org.packt.swarm.petstore.catalog;

import org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.ShrinkWrap;
import org.wildfly.swarm.Swarm;
import org.wildfly.swarm.jaxrs.JAXRSArchive;

public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        Swarm swarm = new Swarm();
swarm.start();

        //1
        JAXRSArchive deployment = ShrinkWrap.create(JAXRSArchive.class, "deployment.war");
        //2
        deployment.addClasses(CatalogApplication.class, CatalogResource.class, Item.class);
        swarm.deploy(deployment);
}
}
```

We created the web archive (1), added the classes that our example
consists of (2), and deployed them on the created container (3). As a
result, we have manually done the same thing that Swarm does for us
automatically.

We have used the `addClass` method to add created classes to
the archive. In a similar way, you are able to use other
`ShrinkWrap` API methods.
The `org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.spec.JavaArchive`* *class apart
from the native archive methods
(`add` and `addDirectory)`) contains the methods
that make it easy to work with classes
(`addClass` and`addPackage`), resources
(`addResource`), and manifests
(`setManifest` and`addManifestResource`).
The `org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.spec.WebArchive`* *class
additionally adds web resource methods
(`addWebResource` and`setWebXML`). As in the
preceding example, using those methods is usually straightforward, but
in the case of any doubts, you can take advantage of
the `ShrinkWrap` Java API.

### Obtaining the default archive {.title}

Isn't `ShrinkWrap` too tedious to be useful in any real-life
circumstances? After all, we don't want to manually add all classes and
resources from our application to the archive. You don't have to worry
about it—you will be able to obtain default deployment from the Swarm
instance:

Copy

``` {.programlisting .language-markup}
package org.packt.swarm.petstore.catalog;

import org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.Archive;
import org.wildfly.swarm.Swarm;

public class Main {

 public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

 Swarm swarm = new Swarm();
 swarm.start();

 //1
 Archive<?> deployment = swarm.createDefaultDeployment();
 swarm.deploy(deployment);

 }

}
```

As you see in the preceding example, we were able to obtain the default
deployment by invoking the `createDefaultDeployment()` method.
After we have it, we can only additional needed resources to it.

### Swarm ShrinkWrap extensions {.title}

Swarm adds its own classes to complement the `ShripWrap` API.
Let's introduce them.

#### JARArchive {.title}

The `org.wildfly.swarm.spi.api.JARArchive` is an alternative
to the `JavaArchive`. Apart from all functions provided by it,
the `JARArchive` adds an API to easily add modules, Maven
dependencies, and service provider implementations. 

#### WARArchive {.title}

As the `WebArchive` adds a functionality on top of
`JavaArchive`, the `WARArchive` adds new features on
top of the `JARArchive`. Apart from an interface that allows
working with web resources, it adds the possibility to easily add the
static web content. Let's look at this for an example.

As usual, we need the`pom.xml:`

Copy

``` {.programlisting .language-markup}
(...)

<!-- 1 -->
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
            <artifactId>undertow</artifactId>
            <version>${version.wildfly.swarm}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

(...)
```

As we are using our own `main`, we will need to add
an `undertow` fraction dependency (1) and configure the
`main` method (2).

Our static content will be a simple **`Hello World`** page:

Copy

``` {.programlisting .language-markup}
<html>
<body>
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

We will add this class to the `webpage` directory inside our
application's resources:

![](./42_files/01fe53d3-a04b-4aba-abad-47c60cac8fb2.png)

The `main` class looks like this:

Copy

``` {.programlisting .language-markup}
package org.packt.swarm.petstore.catalog;

import org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.ShrinkWrap;
import org.wildfly.swarm.Swarm;
import org.wildfly.swarm.undertow.WARArchive;

public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        Swarm swarm = new Swarm();

        //1
        WARArchive deployment = ShrinkWrap.create(WARArchive.class);
        //2
        deployment.staticContent("webpage");

swarm.start().deploy(deployment);

}
}
```

We have created the`WARArchive` and invoked
the `staticContent` method. When we open the web browser, we
will see the **`Hello World`** page:

![](./42_files/eb4e6e0a-e6ba-42d2-8347-98e3a8c8bdf3.jpg)

What has happened? The static content method has copied all non-Java
files from the `webpage` directory (one file in our example)
to the created archive so that they can be seen by `undertow`.

#### JAXRSArchive {.title}

The last type of Swarm archive that we want to look at right now is
the `org.wildfly.swarm.JAXRSArchive`. This archive adds the
ability to create a default JAX-RS application with the application path
set to `"/"`. Till now, we have been doing this manually in
all our examples. With the JAX-RS Archive, this class will be added
automatically.

###  XML configuration {.title}

Although Java API is convenient, this is not the only option that we
have. If you are familiar with the WildFly XML configuration, or if you
are migrating your application to Swarm and have a working XML file, you
don't have to translate it to Java API as you can use it directly.

### Note {.title}

Examples reference: `chapter4/catalog-service-xmlconfig`

Let's return to our database example. You may configure the datasource
using XML. In such a case, the XML configuration will look like this:

Copy

``` {.programlisting .language-markup}
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:datasources:4.0">
    <datasources>
        <drivers>
            <driver name="h2" module="com.h2database.h2">
                <driver-class>org.h2.Driver</driver-class>
                <xa-datasource-class>org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource</xa-datasource-class>
            </driver>
        </drivers>
        <datasource jndi-name="java:jboss/datasources/CatalogDS" pool-name="CatalogDS" enabled="true" use-java-context="true">
            <connection-url>jdbc:h2:mem:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE</connection-url>
            <driver>h2</driver>
        </datasource>
        <datasource jndi-name="java:jboss/datasources/ExampleDS" pool-name="ExampleDS" enabled="true" use-java-context="true">
            <connection-url>jdbc:h2:mem:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE</connection-url>
            <driver>h2</driver>
            <security>
                <user-name>sa</user-name>
                <password>sa</password>
            </security>
        </datasource>
    </datasources>
</subsystem>
```

We have to add this configuration file to the `resources`
directory:

![](./42_files/a8ec28e2-fd37-421d-befb-3b12259e7f69.png)

Finally, we also have to tell Swarm to use the configuration file. The
following is the modified `Main` class:

Copy

``` {.programlisting .language-markup}
package org.packt.swarm.petstore.catalog;

import org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.Archive;
import org.wildfly.swarm.Swarm;
import org.wildfly.swarm.datasources.DatasourcesFraction;
import org.wildfly.swarm.jaxrs.JAXRSArchive;
import org.wildfly.swarm.undertow.UndertowFraction;
import org.wildfly.swarm.undertow.WARArchive;

import java.net.URL;

public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        Swarm swarm = new Swarm();

        //1
        ClassLoader cl = Main.class.getClassLoader();
        URL xmlConfig = cl.getResource("datasources.xml");

        //2
        swarm.withXmlConfig(xmlConfig);

swarm.start().deploy();

}
```

We have obtained the classloader to be able to locate the configuration
file(1). After reading the file, we instructed Swarm to use the
configuration from it (2). 

However, we have used the whole configuration file—will Swarm use all
the subsystems now? The answer is no; only the fractions, whose
dependencies have been specified will be added to the container. Swarm,
given the XML file, will read only the configuration of those subsystems
whose fractions constitute it. You are also able to provide a file with
only those subsystems that you want to configure using XML.

### YAML configuration {.title}

Another way in which you can provide Swarm configuration is YAML data
serialization language.

Once more, let's start with the port-change example. We will start again
with JAX-RS example and modify it to use the YAML configuration.

First, let's create the HTTP-`port.yml` configuration
file inside the `resources` directory:

Copy

``` {.programlisting .language-markup}
swarm:
  http:
    port: 12345
```

The nested properties are translated to flat properties by Swarm. So,
the property specified by the preceding file is translated to
`swarm.http.port`, which we know well already.

To use the following configuration, we have to modify our
`Main` class:

Copy

``` {.programlisting .language-markup}
package org.packt.swarm.petstore.catalog;

import org.wildfly.swarm.Swarm;

import java.net.URL;

public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        Swarm swarm = new Swarm();

//1
        ClassLoader cl = Main.class.getClassLoader();
        URL yamlConfig = cl.getResource("http-port.yml");

//2
        swarm.withConfig(yamlConfig);

swarm.start().deploy();
}
}
```

After obtaining the configuration from the `classpath` (1), we
informed Swarm to use it using the `withConfig` method. That's
it; now, Swarm will use the `12345` port.

#### Project stages {.title}

The strength of the YAML configuration is its ability to provide
different groups properties for different project stages. Again, let's
take a look at the example first. 

The new configuration file looks like this:

Copy

``` {.programlisting .language-markup}
swarm:
  http:
    port: 8080
---
project:
    stage: test
swarm:
    http:
        port: 12345
---
project:
    stage: QA
swarm:
    http:
        port: 12346
```

The different parts of the file gather the configuration for different
project stages. The first group is the default configuration. It is used
when no stage name is provided. The other two specify the configurations
for test and `QA` stages. However, how do you know the stage
in which the application currently runs? You have to provide
the `swarm.project.stage` property. So, consider that, for
example, we run the preceding example with the following command:

Copy

``` {.programlisting .language-markup}
mvn wildfly-swarm:run -Dswarm.project.stage=QA
```

Then, we will be able to access our application on
the `12346` port. 

As you will have noticed in the preceding code, the YAML configuration
makes it easy to create the configuration for different environments and
choose what group of properties should be used using a simple
command-line argument.

### YAML database configuration {.title}

As an another YAML config example, we are going to show you how to
configure the datasources with the YAML configuration file. Let's take a
look:

### Note {.title}

Examples reference:
`chapter 4/catalog-service-database-ymlconfig`

The example is very similar to the XML configuration example. We have to
exchange the configuration file for its YAML equivalent:

Copy

``` {.programlisting .language-markup}
swarm:
  datasources:
    data-sources:
      CatalogDS:
        driver-name: h2
connection-url: jdbc:h2:mem:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
user-name: sa
password: sa
jdbc-drivers:
          h2:
            driver-class-name: org.h2.Driver
xa-datasource-name: org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource
driver-module-name: com.h2database.h2
```

And also need to make the `Main` class use it (1):

Copy

``` {.programlisting .language-markup}
package org.packt.swarm.petstore.catalog;

import org.wildfly.swarm.Swarm;

import java.net.URL;

public class Main {

public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Swarm swarm = new Swarm();

        //1
        ClassLoader cl = Main.class.getClassLoader();
        URL ymlConfig = cl.getResource("datasources.yml");

        swarm.withConfig(ymlConfig);

swarm.start().deploy();
}
}
```

We are going to use such configurations a lot in the examples
throughout the book.
